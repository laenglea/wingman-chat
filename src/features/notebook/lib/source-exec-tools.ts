/**
 * Execution tools (Python + Bash) for notebooks.
 *
 * Mirrors the artifact chat's execute_python_code / execute_bash_code tools,
 * but with notebook sources as the filesystem root.
 *
 * Symmetric mapping:
 *   notebook source path `data.csv` ↔ sandbox path `/home/user/data.csv`
 *
 * Before each run: all sources are loaded into the Pyodide VFS and the
 * bash InMemoryFs at `/home/user/`.
 * After each run: files present at `/home/user/` are diffed against the
 * pre-run sources; additions and modifications are saved back as sources
 * via `onWrite`. Deletions are NOT propagated — sources are treated as
 * append-only from code execution (the model should use `source_create`
 * to explicitly replace, and users remove sources through the UI).
